### Vision
We want to find people who love their dogs as much as we love ours
and surprise and delight them each and every month. Dogs aren’t pets,
they’re family and they deserve the best treats, toys, and seat on the couch.
We’re driven to be the people our dogs think we are. Dog people get it.
      
### Identity
As humans, we love good, clean design—but dogs love fun.
We are always looking to find the balance between clean and playful.


## Content
Before your write for BarkBox, it's important to think about our readers.
Though our voice doesn't change much, our tone adapts to our users' feelings.

### Voice
The foundation for communicating BarkBox products and brand message.
Our voice expresses the core of our personality, while bringing comfort,
ease, and a sense of connection to our users.

### Tone
Conveys your attitude toward what you are writing about and who you
are writing to. When you create content – whether it's introductory
text on the UI, an error message, or a topic in the docs – you are a storyteller.


## Design
We keep these core principles in mind when making design decisions.

### Clarity
Eliminate ambiguity. Enable people to see, understand, and act with confidence.

### Efficiency
Streamline and optimize workflows.
Intelligently anticipate needs to help people work better, smarter, and faster.

### Consistency
Create familiarity and strengthen intuition by applying the same solution to the same problem throughout the product.

### Beauty
Respect people’s time and attention through thoughtful and elegant craftsmanship.


## Accessibility
We are committed to following and complying with best practices when it comes to accessibility.
Our patterns are perceivable, operable, and understandable to users, even when using a screen reader or assistive technologies.

### Keyboard
The tab key navigates through interactive elements on a page.
A visual indicator outlines the focused element—it can be further activated using the keyboard.

### Alt text
Our components use alternative text for icons, complex images,
and actions (like buttons and links) to help people with low or loss of vision use our products.

### Forms
Our forms offer proper use of semantic tags as well as appropriate labelings.
Radio button and checkbox controls provide accessibility as well as design flexibility.

### Contrast
It’s important for BarkBox to meet all web accessibility standards,
including the minimum contrast ratios that the WCAG 2.0 specifies
for text and background colors according to their AA level.
